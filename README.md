# INTRODUCTION

This project is a minimal vim plugin for working with git; with a focus on git blame, git grep, git log --graph, git ls-files, git diff commands.
It's not too overengineered, so there is a chance that it will work for your installation too.

for more information see the doc directory. 

see [help text](https://github.com/MoserMichael/gitblame/blob/master/doc/gitblame.txt)

This plugin is part of my [work environment](https://github.com/MoserMichael/myenv), this project publishes it separately as a neat plugin.
